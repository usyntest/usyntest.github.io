#### Overview
Realtime Chat is a simple yet powerful client-server chat application built from scratch in `C` using `socket programming`. The server listens for incoming client connections, while multiple clients can connect and exchange messages in real time. This project demonstrates low-level network programming, handling `TCP` connections, and implementing bi-directional communication between a server and multiple clients.

It was designed to be minimalistic, efficient, and provide a foundational understanding of networked applications in `C`. The application runs entirely on command-line interfaces, simulating real-time message exchange.

#### Technologies Used
- C
- Socket Programming

#### How to Use
Installation  

```bash
