#### Overview
Mojster is a real-time analytics dashboard designed to track content trends and user engagement on the Moj platform. By reverse-engineering Moj's API, it provides valuable insights into video content, language distribution, and trending hashtags.

Due to the lack of public API for the platform, I had to reverse engineer Moj's API using networking tools like `mitmproxy` and `wireguard`. Found all the endpoints to scrape the data from the platform.

Used `async` programming to make API calls to Moj faster and fetch all the data for the dashboard in real-time.
