I am an undergraduate student at the University of Delhi, pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics, currently in my third year. I am passionate about solving complex problems through the applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision.

Currently, I am working as a Research Engineer Intern at [SimPPL](), where I am developing a social media listening tool called [Arbiter](), which integrates multiple platforms for insightful data analysis.

Previously, I carried out research under [Dr. Vandana Kalra]() and [Dr. Megha Ummat](), focusing on the analysis of various computational techniques, including deep learning and traditional machine learning approaches, for detecting COVID-19 from X-ray images.

I also interned at the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research]() under [Dr. Akshay Aggarwal](), where I explored the field of Biometrics and gained insights into identity verification technologies.
