I am Uday Sharma a final year student at University of Delhi working towards my **Bachelors (Honors with Research) in Computer Science**. I am passionate about machine learning, large-scale data processing, and high-performance computing.

I am currently working at [CERN]() where I am developing [NeutrinoReview]() a Systematic Review AI Tool aimed at automating literature reviews.

Previously I was working as a Research Engineer at [SimPPL]() where I was the Technical Lead for [Arbiter](), a social listening tool utilized by civic organizations like Nest fact-checkers in Mongolia, in collaboration with DW Germany.

Additionally, I have also worked as a Research Intern at [IISER Bhopal]() and [Sri Guru Gobind Singh College of Commerce]() in the fields of Biometrics and Medical Image Analysis respectively.

Right now I am looking for potential advisors and ideas for my Bachelor Thesis. If you have a good idea, I would love to implement it.
