I am Uday Sharma, a Computer Science student at the University of Delhi, passionate about machine learning, large-scale data processing, and high-performance computing. My work spans software engineering, AI research, and system optimization, where I focus on building scalable architectures, designing ML pipelines, and working with distributed systems.

Currently, I am a Research Engineer Intern at [SimPPL](https://simppl.org), where I led the development of [Arbiter](https://arbiter.simppl.org), a real-time social listening tool that processes billions of social media posts. I designed and optimized its data pipelines, ML-driven analytics, and vector search infrastructure, reducing cloud costs by 75% and cutting query times from minutes to under a second. Beyond this, my research in biometrics and medical imaging has led to facial recognition systems at [IISER Bhopal]() and a deep learning model for COVID-19 detection, published in an [IEEE conference paper]().

I have experience working with **full-stack development**, **cloud computing**, and **database engineering**. My portfolio showcases my projects, research, and technical contributions in AI, software development, and computational sciences.

I am always looking for exciting research opportunities, collaborations, and challenging engineering problems to solve. Feel free to explore my work and connect with me!
