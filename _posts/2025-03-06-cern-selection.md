## Introduction
CERN or European Organization for Nuclear Physics every year invites students from various backgrounds to join the CERN Summer Student Program in Geneva, Switzerland. The program is open to everyone around the world resulting in around 10k applicants in total  hence making it very competitive in nature.

People from Member & Associate Member states are given priority; these are countries which provide funding to CERN and in return students from these countries are prioritized to fill certain number of spots in the program. These spots once filled no matter how good you are you won't be selected. 

India is an associate member state and as you can imagine for those few spots you have to put up a tough fight. In 2024, India had 5 spots and for that CERN received 5,273 applications making it an **[acceptance rate of 0.1%](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2932097/files/CERN-HR-STAFF-STAT-2024-RESTR.pdf)**.

## Background
I was interested in computers from a young age. I was introduced to programming by a friend of mine named [Sujal](https://sujal.dev/) (shoutout to him) in 9th grade and I loved it. As you can imagine when you love something out of passion you start fucking around and finding out so that's what I did. I started learning to program using online tutorials and CS50 (thanks David J. Malan) which help set the base for my love for building stuff out since I wasn't doing this to get an internship or a job which makes you very tunnel visioned I was just doing all this out of curiosity.

After school I entered University of Delhi enthusiasticly thinking now I only have to study what I love. I joined Sri Guru Gobind Singh College of Commerce which is affiliated to University of Delhi. To anybody wondering University of Delhi is not a technical university mostly focused towards Humanities and Business education, STEM is particularly not a strong suite of the university. 

In my college there are no tech socieities, no coding culture, no alumini to look up to and to be precise there isn't particularly a culture in the college where people are even remotely interested in Computer Science at all. By the end of the program either they take up positions in consulting firms or join a masters program to get placed.

So when I came to college I was pretty devastated since coming to college I expected to find a group of like minded people but since this was not the case I realized I was on my own and have to do everything without any help. 

I engaged in research activities with one of my professor Dr. Vandana Kalra who was working in trying to detect COVID-19 in lung X-Rays using CNNs which was my first research internship and after that I went on to work under Dr. Akshay Agarwal at IISER Bhopal in Biometrics. These two research internships help me lay my foundations in Machine Learning and find an interest of mine which later helped me find a role which change the course of my career for good.


## SimPPL: The Inflection Point

Working as an Research Engineer at SimPPL was the holy grail in getting into CERN Summer Student Program. I remember a good friend of mine Priyanshi (shoutout to her) applying to a position at SimPPL but not doing it due to other commitments showing me the assignment they sent me. And the assignment said if someone could get data from Moj (social media platform) they'll hire them 90%.

As you can imagine I got onto it and in 3 days reverse engineered Moj's API and collected the data and made a dashboard out of it. After that I gave the interview for the position of Research Engineer and got selected. This internship taught me more than I could've imagined and I will forever think of it as the primary stepping stone in my career.

This internship brought immense mentorship from two of the best people I have met Dhara and Swapneel (shoutout to them) who taught me everything from how to present something to solving really hard technical problems.

After joining SimPPL I started working as a solo developer on a project called [Arbiter](https://arbiter.simppl.org/) that was dead. This is what I dedicated the next 10 months of life to where I developed or resurrected Arbiter from scratch.

I developed data pipelines from multiple social media platforms, optimized these data pipelines and created a efficient working backend and integrated with developing a frontend. I also developed a semantic search infrastructure to search over billions of data for a more accurate social media analysis. 

In 4 months I developed an initial MVP and pitched it to Nest fact-checkers in Mongolia, in collaboration with DW Germany. Soon instead of being a sole developer we had a team for the project where my role turned into a Technical Lead for the project facilitating integration of features like AI Assistant, in-house topic modeling scatter plot, caching mechanism for faster results, better storage architecture for large scale data storage, designing efficient schemas for database.

Apart from the real world technical challenges I also learned soft skills like how to design features and not over engineered complex technical solutions to simple problems. I also learned how to present any type of material ranging from seasoned engineers to people who are not technically literate.

I am very much grateful for these soft skills I learned at SimPPL since I had nobody telling me how to ask good questions, design solutions, research topics and present them, and the best one of all "what are cc and bcc in an email?" (thankyou dhara!).


## Applying to CERN: The Vulnerable Truth
My introduction to CERN was through the movie Angels & Demons and I was fascinated by it but never thought I'll end up working there. In an one-to-one session with swapneel I got introduced to the program since he also did it during his undergrad. And that's when he told me then we should help you prepare for making an application there. It was then that I knew that I had struck gold in terms of people.

Initially I believed it was litreally impossible to get an international internship not coming from one of the IITs and that too not being formally trained in Physics. And if I am being honest I wasn't going to apply at all, it was only after Swapneel convinced me I applied.

I made my application on the last day of the deadline having my materials checked and reviewed from Swapneel and Dhara. Also I didn't have a recommendation letter from any of my professors but Swapneel.

On Mar 7th, I received an email for an interview with potential supervisor which made me go crazy with anxiety since interviews are very rare in selection for the summer student programs. Over the weekend I studied everything I could about the project the interview was for, made system design diagrams, read previous year student's report for the project, and probably went over my 3 minute introduction like 100 times which took me atleast 12 hours (not kidding).

I got cold feet the night before the interview and had to take up a call with Swapneel since I was so nervous about the interview and couldn't handle the stress. After that me and him had a long talk which gave me some sense. On May 10th I gave the interviewed for the position and was very happy since I was happy with what I said although I wanted to say a lot more but time didn't allow.

## Acceptance and What It Means

On May 14th, it was the day of Holi I remember vividly I was sitting in the hall watching some stupid show when a notification popped up from CERN that said congratulations. It was a moment I'll remember my entire life and will cherish forever.

I got selected out of 10k applicants to come to CERN and work on the things I love which was simply astonishing. When I entered college I never thought I'll get to attend such a prestigious student program. Working over the summer in Switzerland sounded simply too good to be true. 

Over this summer I'll be working at CERN in collaboration with World Health Organization on the NeutrinoReview project which is a Systematic Review AI Tool aimed at automating literature reviews under the supervision of Elias Sandner. I hope to get a lot of exposure working on this project while collaborating with such diverse team where people come from all around the world.

While working at CERN, I want to learn how things are done at an organization of such scale, how projects like LHC are bought to life, and how to carry out research that might change the discourse of human future. I am looking forward to collaborating with some of the brightest minds of the 21st century.

## How SimPPL Helped me Get here

SimPPL taught me to think outside of the box and not just on technical aspects of development but from a product design point of view which gave me a better prespective. Along with this they gave me freedom to test out things and experiment with different approaches which helped me become dynamic in nature.

Experiencing working as a solo developer gave me the confidence to build and ship and take on the challenges that come with it like in production bugs, testing it and handling bugs in production. Among other things I also learned how to work in research-industry collaboration which helped me shape an understanding towards Research & Development.

Learning to write was something I was never good at, but this habit was somewhat forced into me which I'll be grateful for in my entire career. I learned how to tell my story better in applications which also led to my selection in the CERN Summer Student Program.

## Advice for Future Applicants

Deadline for the application is during late January but try to start thinking about your application atleast a month before since the more thought you put into your application the better. Application at the time only consists 4 documents in total: application form, resume, motivation letter, and reference letters.

Your resume is the most important part of your application I believe since selection is mostly based around whether or not your resume has the keywords that supervisor searched for while finding candidates from the pool. Think of resume's as the only advocate of your skills since interviews only happen in rare cases so this is the only document that can vouch for your skillset.

Make more than just one iteration of your motivation letter and ask someone to proof read it other than yourself. Also, informing the peron you're asking for a reference letter 1 month in advance is the best way since it actually gives them time to write you a good reference letter.

## Final Thoughts

Competition for opportunities is increasing day by day which makes us tunnel visioned leading to negative thoughts and lack of concern for the mental health. Try to take care of yourself as all works out in the end but the health (be mental or physical) takes a lot of time and effort to restore.

Everybody works at their own pace try not to reverse engineer someone else's career, rather than going after binary goals try to enjoy the learning process. Just remember it took Virat Kohli 18 years to say _"ee sala cup namde"_.
