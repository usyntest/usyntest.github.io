## Introduction

Deploying web applications can be overwhelming, especially when handling multiple services like a frontend, backend, and database. This guide will walk you through deploying a **Next.js frontend**, **FastAPI backend**, and **PostgreSQL database** using **Docker** and **Nginx as a reverse proxy**.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand how to:
- Use **Docker Compose** to manage multi-container applications.
- Configure **Nginx** as a reverse proxy for your frontend and backend.
- Secure your application with **SSL certificates**.

## Understanding the Architecture

We'll deploy the following services:
- **Frontend**: A Next.js application running on port `3000`.
- **Backend**: A FastAPI service running on port `8000`.
- **Database**: A PostgreSQL instance for data storage.
- **Nginx**: A reverse proxy to handle traffic and SSL termination.

Docker Compose will orchestrate these services and ensure they run together in an isolated network.

---

## Step 1: Setting Up Docker Compose

Our **docker-compose.yml** file defines how all the services run together:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    image: <link_to_image>
    container_name: fastapi_app
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    depends_on:
      - db
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://${DATABASE_USERNAME}:${DATABASE_PASSWORD}@${DATABASE_HOST}:${DATABASE_PORT}/${DATABASE_NAME}
    networks:
      - app_network

  db:
    image: postgres:latest
    container_name: postgres_db
    restart: always
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: ${DATABASE_USERNAME}
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${DATABASE_PASSWORD}
      POSTGRES_DB: ${DATABASE_NAME}
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    networks:
      - app_network

  nginx:
    image: nginx:latest
    container_name: nginx_proxy
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
      - /etc/letsencrypt/<path>/fullchain.pem:/etc/letsencrypt/live/<path>/fullchain.pem
      - /etc/letsencrypt/<path>/privkey.pem:/etc/letsencrypt/live/<path>/privkey.pem
    depends_on:
      - app
    networks:
      - app_network

  frontend:
    image: <link_to_image>
    container_name: nextjs_frontend
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=<api_url>
    depends_on:
      - app
    networks:
      - app_network

networks:
  app_network:

volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

## Step 2: Configuring Nginx as a Reverse Proxy

The Nginx configuration file (**nginx.conf**) routes requests to the correct service:

```nginx
http {
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name <url>;
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }

    server {
        listen 443 ssl;
        server_name <url>;
        
        ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/<path>/fullchain.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/<path>/privkey.pem;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://fastapi_app:8000;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        }
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Running the Application

### Build and Run the Containers
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
This will start all services in the background.

### Verify Everything is Running
```bash
docker ps
```
You should see containers for `nginx_proxy`, `fastapi_app`, `nextjs_frontend`, and `postgres_db`.

### Restarting a Service
If you make changes, restart a specific service:
```bash
docker-compose restart nginx
```

## Conclusion

Youâ€™ve successfully deployed a **Next.js + FastAPI application with PostgreSQL**, managed with **Docker and Nginx**. This setup ensures:
âœ… Scalable and isolated services.
âœ… Secure deployment with HTTPS.
âœ… Easy container management using Docker Compose.

Now, you can focus on developing your application while Docker and Nginx handle the deployment. ðŸš€
